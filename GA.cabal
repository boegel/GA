Description:
  This package provides a framework for working with genetic
  algorithms. A genetic algorithm is an evolutionary technique, 
  inspired by biological evolution, to evolve entities that perform
  as good as possible in terms of a predefined criterion (the scoring 
  function). Note: lower scores are assumed to indicate better entities.
  The GA module provides a type class for defining entities and the
  functions that are required by the genetic algorithm.
  Checkpointing in between generations is available, as is automatic
  restoring from the last available checkpoint.
